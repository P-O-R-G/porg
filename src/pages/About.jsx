            PORG is an application that will allow American Sign Language (ASL) speakers to communicate with 
            non-ASL speakers using sign language translation. The program will introduce the user to a video 
            platform to record or upload the person signing and translate the signs into written English. PORG 
            hopes to be an application used by both people who primarily use ASL to communicate and people 
            who have never learned the language.

            American Sign Language, or ASL, is a visual language that uses movements in the hands, arms, and 
            face to express meaning. ASL is the predominant sign language of deaf communities in the United 
            States, with the Rhode Island Commission on the Deaf and Hard of Hearing estimating that over half 
            a million people throughout the US use ASL to communicate as their native language [1]. Despite 
            ASLâ€™s prominence, there exists a significant communication barrier between ASL-speakers and those 
            who cannot sign. Our solution provides a way for an ASL-speaker and someone unfamiliar with the 
            language to communicate in real-time.
